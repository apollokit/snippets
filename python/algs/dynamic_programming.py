# The basic idea of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to scan the entire list and at each position find the maximum sum of the sublist ending there. This is achieved by keeping a current_max for the current list index and a global_max. The algorithm is as follows

def find_max_sum_sublist(lst): 
    # use Kadane's alg
    if (len(lst) < 1): 
        return 0

    curr_max = lst[0]
    global_max = lst[0]
    length_array = len(lst)
    for i in range(1, length_array):
        # if the contributions before elem i are net-negative, then they don't
        # help with maximization. Ignore and start at i
        if curr_max < 0: 
            curr_max = lst[i]
        # seea if extending the sublist helps
        else:
            curr_max += lst[i]
        # does the current sublist have a greater sum than any we've seen thus
        # far?
        if global_max < curr_max:
            global_max = curr_max

    return global_max
